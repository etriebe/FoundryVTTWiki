1. Targeting is *required* for making attacks in combat. In order to target, hold ALT (Windows) or OPTION (MacOS) and select the enemy token to attack. This allows me, as DM, to setup a lot more automation so combat moves more smoothly. You will end up with a target on the character token you are attempting to attack. Now you can roll your attack. You won't be able to attack unless you do this!

1. Attacking - After targeting, choose your attack and click on either the hotbar or on your charater sheet to roll. Everything should happen automatically. If you were successful, you will see a card like this, which show you what your attack/damage rolls were. You can click on either of the roll formulas to see exactly what dice were rolled.

1. Advantage/disadvantage - Rolling with advantage can be achieved by holding **shift** while clicking your attack button/hotbar. Rolling with disadvantage can be achieved by holding **control (Windows)/command (MacOS)** while clicking your attack button/hotbar. Using a versatile attack can be done by holding V while attacking. Versatile attacks are like for a Longsword which can be wielded with 1 or 2 hands. The versatile attack would be done with 2 hands. If you want 2-handed to be the default and 1-handed to be versatile, talk with me and we can get this fixed up. :)

**Character Sheet**

1. Adding favorites - Right click an item on your sheet and select "Add Favorite" to get it added to show up in the Attributes page. The Actions page is pre-populated with a bunch of combat-specific actions.
